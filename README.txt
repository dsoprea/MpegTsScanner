MpegTsScanner
=============

Scan packets from a MPEG-TS file. One library (tsscanner) provides the basic 
functionality to process through a MPEG-TS file. The other library 
(tsfindfirstprogram) provides functionality to grab information on the first 
program found. This latter functionality is useful for getting information from
a single-program video, such as that recorded from an ATSC/DVB television 
tuner.

Requirements
============

Depends on the LIBDVBPSI library.

Building
========

Execute the following from the project root.

  ./configure
  make

  As admin:

    make install

  To build examples (install must be done first):

    make examples

Example Application
===================
